Search engine optimization: 
Driving thousands and thousands of people to our websites.

People who can benefit from SEO:
1. Business owners who have been investing for paid search. By ranking for keywords organically they benefit from increased traffic FOR FREE.
This is a long term strategy. 

Organic search is a method for entering one or a plurality of search items in a single data string into a search engine. Organic search results are listings on search engine results pages that appear because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to their being advertisements. In contrast, non-organic search results may include pay per click advertising.
Organic listings in Google search for example is what Google finds more authorative and relevant for the users.

With Pay Per Click (PPC), people are literally paying for the ranking.For example when people search in Google, there are certain ads on the top or on the side because people have paid Google to be there. 

SEO is fantastic for business owners as they don't want to pay all the time to be listed on top. PPC is usually short-term.

SEO is measurable for how much we pay and how much we get back for our money.

Local SEO is very important to drive our website locally, like in my city where can I find a barber.

2. In blogging Content Is King. With SEO, we can grow our audience incredibly fast by ranking great content. Keyword search optimization will bring more traffic and may also help to moneytize our sites (if we display ads for example).
